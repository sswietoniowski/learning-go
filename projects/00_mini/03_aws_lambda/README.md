This is a simple demonstration of how to create a serverless application using AWS Lambda.

## Features

This application has the following features:

- just returns a simple message.

## Technologies

The application is built using the following technologies, libraries, frameworks, and tools:

- [Go](https://golang.org/),
- [AWS Lambda for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go),
- [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) [ðŸ“–](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

## Setup

To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- [Go](https://golang.org/),
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

Of course, you also need an AWS account or a **LocalStack** instance running (requires Docker).

To install `localstack`, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install localstack
```

To start `localstack`, you can run the following command:

```bash
localstack start -d
```

Alternatively, you can use the `docker-compose` file provided in this repository:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If you want to use the AWS CLI with `localstack`, please follow [this](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal) guide.

First you need to create a role for your Lambda function. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name lambda-ex --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

For `localstack`, you can need to add to every command the `--endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566` flag (or define an alias `awslocal` for the AWS CLI with the same flag).

```bash
alias awslocal="aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566"
```

Where `trust-policy.json` is a file with the following content:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you need to attach the `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` policy to the role:

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name lambda-ex --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
```

Now you can build the application:

Windows:

```powershell
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
go build -o bootstrap main.go
```

Linux:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bootstrap main.go
```

And then you can create a zip file with the application:

Windows:

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path .\bootstrap -DestinationPath .\bootstrap.zip
```

Linux:

```bash
zip bootstrap.zip bootstrap
```

Then you can create the Lambda function (you need to replace the role ARN with the one you created):

```bash
aws lambda create-function --function-name aws-lambda --zip-file fileb://./bootstrap.zip --handler bootstrap --runtime provided.al2 --role arn:aws:iam::PUT_YOUR_ID_HERE:role/lambda-ex
```

To list the functions, you can run the following command:

```bash
aws lambda list-functions
```

Finally, you can invoke the function:

```bash
aws lambda invoke --invocation-type RequestResponse --function-name aws-lambda --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out --payload '{"What is your name?":"John Doe","What is your year of birth?":2000}' response.json
```

In the `response.json` file, you should see something like this:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, John Doe! You are 24 years old."
}
```

If you have received the time out error, you can increase the timeout for the function:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name aws-lambda --timeout 300
```

Alternatively we can use:

```bash
aws lambda wait function-active --function-name aws-lambda
```

To remove the function, you can run the following command:

```bash
aws lambda delete-function --function-name aws-lambda
```

To remove the role, you can run the following command:

```bash
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name lambda-ex --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
aws iam delete-role --role-name lambda-ex
```
