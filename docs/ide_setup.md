# IDE Setup 2024-01-29

As far as I know, the best IDE (as of now) for Go is **[GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)**. It's a paid IDE, but you can get a free license if you're a student or a teacher.

Because I'm a big fan of Visual Studio Code I will try to use it as much as I can (knowing that it's not the best choice for Go development).

Here I will describe how to set up VS Code for Go development, as a start read [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) tutorial and also [this](https://levene.me/boost-your-golang-development-with-these-top-vscode-extensions) one.

## Install SDK

To help you set up quickly, you can download and install a binary release from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

## Install Extensions

To work with Go in Visual Studio Code you will need to install some extensions.

I've chosen the following ones:

- **[Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)** - after installing this extension, please remember to install all the tools (`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Go: Install/Update Tools`),
- **[Go Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=premparihar.gotestexplorer)**,
- **[Go Auto Struct Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaldy22.go-auto-struct-tag)**,
- **[Go Outliner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=766b.go-outliner)**,
- **[Go Doc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msyrus.go-doc)**.

## More customizations

Here you'll find some more customizations that I've made to my VS Code setup.
